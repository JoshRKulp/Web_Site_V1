			I’M ONE OF THOSE DESIGNERS WHO IS COMPLETELY OBSESSED WITH THE WEB.
			I’ve been designing & building web sites for over five years now & can’t seem to get enough of it. I spend my days working for clients & my nights working on personal projects like Huurd & Designers Blueprint. I am constantly honing my craft, learning new methods & trends, I am never satisfied. I write now and then, check out my latest article CSS animations : adding the finishing touches.
			I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia with my stunning wife. I have a list of great clients both near & far. I am always seeking new projects that are both exciting & challenging. If you are in need of branding, print, web design, or web development let’s chat, we can work it out.

				MY SERVICES
				Whether it's a logo you need, business cards, or a whole new online presence I am the guy who can get it done for you. I build my sites with either ExpressionEngine or Wordpress. What does that mean for you? The sites are built with a CMS (content management system) so you have the power to edit your finished site easily without the need to know html. You won't need to call me every time you need something done.
				That doesn't mean you can't ring me up to ask questions or get my advice, I am always here to help. You won't see me disappear the minute the check clears.

				WIREFRAMES
				This is all about sketching ideas. Websites, logos, or stationary all go through this stage. I want to come up with a solid foundation before I start building your brand, website, or wardrobe.

				DESIGN
				All of our hard work finally starts to pay off. This is why I love my job. I get to take someone else's idea & give it life. I love the moment when the client sets their eyes on the design & realizes I got it right.

				I take pride in all aspects of my work, & the build is no exception. I am always figuring out better ways to approach how a site should be built. Mobile, desktop, or tablet, you can trust me with it all.
